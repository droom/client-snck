<hr/>



<dl>
   <dt>What time do you open on a Saturday?</dt>
   <dd>We open the doors at 9am on a Saturday to start giving out tickets for the food bank, which opens at 11am. In the meantime, you are welcome to share a tea or coffee with us, and a pastry in our cafe space.</dd>

<dt>What time do you close?</dt>
<dd>We close at 2pm on Saturdays</dd>

<dt>What time is lunch served?</dt>
<dd>Lunch is served at about 12:30pm</dd>

<dt>Do I need to fill out any forms?</dt>
<dd>Absolutely not. We won’t ask you any questions whatsoever, you are free to use the food bank regardless of your personal situation, income, address, status or anything else. We don’t keep any records or even take your name, so you can come completely anonymously.</dd>

<dt>How does the ticket system work?</dt>
<dd>As we get really busy on a Saturday, we use a ticket system to make things run as smoothly as possible. When you arrive, one of our team will give you a raffle ticket with a number on it (this could be any number - it doesn’t start from 1!) At 11am, we’ll call out your number and you can come and take your shopping, so listen out for your number being called by one of our volunteers at the door to the hall. We run a ticket system so that people don’t have to stand up in a queue for a long time, but can sit down and relax knowing they will get called when it is their time to use the food bank.</dd>

<dt>What kind of food do you give away?</dt>
<dd>As our food comes from surplus food that would otherwise go to waste, we never know exactly what we get in from week to week but we usually have fruit, veg, pasta and tinned food.</dd>

<dt>Are teas and coffees free?</dt>
<dd>Yep!</dd>

<dt>Are children allowed?</dt>
<dd>Absolutely! We try and put on activities for kids of all ages every Saturday, but we do ask that parents supervise their children at all times, and don’t leave them unattended as we can’t be responsible for them while you’re in the building.</dd>

<dt>Is the food halal? Do you do a vegan or vegetarian option?</dt>
<dd>As our food comes from surplus food that would otherwise go to waste unfortunately we can’t guarantee that our meat is halal every week, but whenever it comes it we make sure we use it for our community lunches, and we will always let you know if the food is or isn’t halal. We always do a vegetarian option.</dd>

<dt>Can I get my lunch to takeaway?</dt>
<dd>Yep!</dd>

<dt>Can I get a takeaway for a friend?</dt>
<dd>It depends how busy we are, so if you want extras there may be some available but you’ll have to stick around until service is done to know if there are extra meals to take away.</dd>

<dt>Can I smoke in the garden?</dt>
<dd>Sorry — our building is smoke and vape free so you’ll need to go out the front.</dd>

<dt>Can I pick up a ticket for a friend?</dt>
<dd>You can only pick up a ticket for yourself. If you’re picking up a ticket for someone who has mobility or care issues and can’t come in, please speak to a member of the volunteer team to see if we can arrange an alternative system for them to get them what they need.</dd>

<dt>I noticed that some people pick up a food parcel instead of getting a ticket. Why is this?</dt>
<dd>This is because we make up a small number of food parcels for guests who have mobility issues so can’t use the foodbank the usual way. Please speak to a member of the volunteer team if you would like to get a food parcel made up for you because you can’t access the food bank.</dd>

<dt>Can I really eat for free, or do I have to make a donation?</dt>
<dd>Yes, you really can. We won’t ask you for any information about yourself, or get you to fill in a form either.</dd>

<dt>Can I come as often as I like?</dt>
<dd>You can come and eat for free as often and for as long as you like.</dd>

<dt>Do you give away groceries and clothes etc during the week?</dt>
<dd>Yes, we give away groceries, clothes, nappies and toiletries during the week. Whatever we have is usually left out in the cafe area for you to help yourself.</dd>

<dt>What time are you open during the week?</dt>
<dd>The Community Caff is open 10am-3pm during the week. You might notice the door open at other times- that’s because we run some youth activities in the evenings and share the space with other groups who might have events or activities running.</dd>
</dl>



<h2 class="caps">DELIVERIES</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Do you do deliveries? If so, to who?</dt>
<dd>We have a small team of delivery drivers who deliver groceries and hot meals to our guests who are unable to get to us on a Saturday afternoon for health reasons or care demands. If you need food but cannot get to us for health/care needs, please drop an email to hello@soutnorwoodcommunitykitchen.co.uk and we will let you know if there is space on our deliveries list. Please note that all of our drivers are volunteers, and you may get a different driver every week. The timing of your delivery may also change slightly week by week, but we aim to get your food parcel to you between 1pm and 3pm.</dd>


<dt>Do you do deliveries during the week?</dt>
<dd>Unfortunately at the moment we only do deliveries on a Saturday.</dd>

<h3>VOLUNTEERING</h3>

<dt>I’m under 16, can I still volunteer?</dt>
<dd>We have a limited number of spots for under 16s to volunteer with us, and you’ll need to have a parent/guardian with you at all times. If you’d like to see whether we have any under 16 slots, please email hello@southnorwoodcommunitykitchen.co.uk</dd>

<dt>I’d like to volunteer during the week. Who do I contact?</dt>
<dd>Please email ashleigh@southnorwoodcommunitykitchen.co.uk</dd>

<dt>I’d like to volunteer on the weekend. Who do I contact?</dt>
<dd>Please sign up on our sign up link here.</dd>

<dt>I’d like to volunteer on a Saturday but there are no shifts available! Can I still help out?</dt>
<dd>As lots of people are interested in volunteering with us on a Saturday, unfortunately our shifts fill up fast so make sure you plan ahead and get your shifts in early! We are open to everyone so if you can’t volunteer but want to be part of the action then why not come down, have lunch and get chatting to some neighbours you never knew you had?</dd>

<dt>I’d like to volunteer but can’t do the full hours, can I still help out?</dt>
<dd>All new volunteers need to be able to help out for the full shift if it’s their first time (unless there is a health-related reason you’re not able to). After this we can be more flexible and you can discuss with the kitchen or FOH lead in charge on the day.</dd>

<dt>Why haven’t I heard back regarding my query?</dt>
<dd>We are a very small team and often have emergencies to prioritise given the nature of the work we do, so please be patient if it takes us a while to get back to you.</dd>
</dl>



<h2 class="caps">DONATING</h2>

<dl>
<dt>what donations do you take?</dt>
<dd>We take any and all food donations that are in-date and unopened. We also take men's, women's & children's clothing above 5yrs old. All items need to be clean & in wearable condition. As we don’t have a lot of storage, we ask that clothes donations be "time of year" appropriate, i.e. we aren’t able to accept summer clothes in winter or vice versa. We take good condition shoes and trainers (again, we ask that they be "time of year" appropriate). We always need sanitary products, toiletries, nappies and wet wipes. We take towels and sleeping bags if they are in good, clean condition.</dd>

<dt>What common items don’t you take?</dt>
<dd>We don’t take pillows or duvets unless they are packaged and new. We don’t take electrical equipment or baby equipment (eg baths, carry cots etc.) Nor do we take electrical items, furniture or large items.</dd>

<dt>…but I saw you put a Facebook post out for a large item the other day!</dt>
<dd>We occasionally put out posts for specific items that a guest is in need of, for example if they have moved into new accommodation and need essential items, or have just had a baby. As these items go straight to the guest, we don’t need to use our storage so can help them with these as a one-off.</dd>

<dt>I’ve got some stuff from your list I’d like to donate. When can I do so?</dt>
<dd>You can drop items from our list off to us any time we are open (Tues-Fri 10am-3pm or Saturdays 9:30am-2pm). Just come in and pass your donations onto to anyone in an SNCK t-shirt or apron. Unfortunately we’re unable to take donations at other times.</dd>

<dt>Can you pick up my donations?</dt>
<dd>We aren’t collecting donations at the moment, unless it’s a large food donation. Please email donations@southnorwoodcommunitykitchen.co.uk if you have a large donation that needs collecting.</dd>

<dt>I have some stuff, not on your list to donate, would you like it?</dt>
<dd>Unfortunately not.</dd>

<dt>I’d like to hire a space at Socco Cheta but I don’t know how to go about it. Who do I contact to inquire about it?</dt>
<dd>Please contact hello@southnorwoodcommunitykitchen.co.uk.</dd>
