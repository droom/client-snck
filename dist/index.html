<h3 class="caps">Today (Thursday 16th Jan 2025)</h3>


<h3 class="caps">Building Co-operative Communities</h3>


<p>We are a community that uses food and people power to build new ways to live together, based on care, solidarity and collaboration. Our vision is for a society where power, wealth and democracy are equally distributed. The kitchen is much more than just a place to eat — it's where people form new friendships and a sense of belonging.</p>

<p>As well as hot meals, we also give out groceries as part of our Community Lunch on a Saturday from 9am, and have a small amount also available during the week.</p>

<p>Anytime that we are open we also redistribute donated clothes, bedding, kitchenware, nappies and toiletries.</p>

<h3 class="caps">About</h3>
<p>Launched in 2017 by a small group of committed local people looking to provide free food for local homeless people, we now welcome hundreds of people every week to our table and are run by a huge group of incredible volunteers.</p>

   <p>We currently serve ~330 meals every week. This is possible because of the incredible people that power the kitchen.</p>

<p>We run an open access, cooperative community space where everyone is welcome five days a week.</p> 

<p>We are run by and for the community</p>

<p>Central to our work in bringing people together is the making and sharing of freshly-cooked, nutritious, hot meals. Over 90% of our ingredients come from food that would otherwise unused.</p>


<p>We redistribute resources back into the community so that everyone can get what they need to live well.</p>

<p>
   Over the last two years we have mobilised hundreds of local people on the cost of living crisis, local authority malpractice, local and national housing issues and the proposed closure of local community assets.
</p>





<h3 class="caps">Our values</h3>

<p>We use food as a mechanism to bring people together across difference, untap our collective power and change the social conditions that oppress us and our fellow human beings.</p>
<p>We believe that there is plenty to go round, if you look at resources and capacity differently to how our society currently sees things.</p>


<h3 class="caps">Signposting</h3>

<p>We provide signposting, information and ongoing support to guests in partnership with South West London Law Centres. This work feeds directly into our advocacy and campaign work, giving us the information on the ground that enables us to understand what our community needs and what needs to change.</p>



<h3 class="caps">Partners</h3>

<p>We are grateful to our generous donors, funders past and present, for enabling us to keep doing what we do. Our incredible space is at Socco Cheta Community Hub that we share with Croydon Domino’s Club and the Association of Jamaicans in Great Britain.</p>

<h3 class="caps">Community Assets</h3>

<p>We organise to keep community assets in use for the community.</p>

<h5>Save Our Nurseries</h5>
<p>Last year we ran a successful Save Our Nurseries campaign in order to maintain the much loved Maintained Nursery, Crosfield.
</p>

<h5>Social Housing on Regina Road</h5>

<p>We continue to build power with residents of Regina Road, having mobilised over 50 residents throughout 2021 and 2022 to demand better quality council housing from the Local Authority, and now chair a bi-monthly, cross sector housing and homelessness meeting, bringing together over 40 people from the charity sector, local authority and local councillors to work together to find sustainable solutions to the housing crisis in Croydon.</p>

<h3 class="caps">Change the world one meal at a time</h3>



<h3 class="caps">Youth Caff</h3>

<p>We’re proud to work in collaboration with Reaching Higher to run our Youth Caff, a youth-run weekly space for local young people to come and meet friends, chill, have some food and stay off the streets. At the youth caff local young people learn cooking skills, customer service, project management and, importantly, collective ways of living together as a community.</p>
<p>Youth Caff runs on Monday evenings from 4pm-6pm.</p>

<p>To find out more or sign a young person to youth caff, go to Reaching Higher’s website here https://www.reachinghigher.org.uk/</p>
