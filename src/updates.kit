<h2 class="caps">Awaab's Law- Holding Social Landlords to Account for Damp and Mould</h2>

<label>August 22, 2024</label>

<p>This is Awaab Ishak. He died when he was 2 years old due to a respiratory condition caused by extensive damp and mould in his flat. He will never be forgotten.</p>

<p>Access to safe, secure and adequate housing is a human right as outlined by international human rights law. However, millions of people across the UK are denied this basic human right and are living in housing that is substandard and detrimental to their mental and physical health.</p>

<p>Over the last 30 years, a political programme of privatisation and deregulation of housing has allowed the landlord class, including local authorities, to get away with forcing working class people to live in homes that are not fit for human habitation. Issues such as mould, disrepair, infestations, leaks, lack of heating or insulation and lack of fire safety to name a few, are common in both social and private rented housing across the country. Not only is it scandalous that these issues are so widespread in the first place, but deregulation has led to a situation where landlords and social housing providers are able to avoid resolving these issues and avoid accountability. This is something we know all too well in South Norwood - it was only when residents at Regina Road organised themselves collectively and built a campaign to highlight the condition of their flats, that Croydon Council were forced to take them seriously, begin repairs and begin moving people to adequate housing. Read more about the condition of flats at Regina Road here: ‘I had to put my kids on inhalers because of the black mould’, Inside Croydon.</p>

<p>Awaab’s death was a result of policies and decisions made by an elite political class that will never understand what it’s like to live in substandard housing. Awaab’s family had been complaining to their housing provider, Rochdale Boroughwide Housing (RBH), about the damp and mould in their property for years - they even noted that theirs wasn’t even the worst on the estate. However, their complaints weren’t taken seriously, and the housing provider even had the audacity to blame the issue on the family’s ‘ritual bathing habits’ (of which there was no evidence), rather than tackle the issue themselves as the housing provider. A system that allowed RBH to behave like this with no fear of accountability led to Awaab’s death.</p>

<p>The inquest into Awaab’s death found that he died as a result of the conditions he was living in. It also found that 80% of RBH’s properties had damp and mould in them. Its chief executive earned £170,000 during the same year Awaab died.</p>

<p>However, Awaab’s legacy will live on. Following his death and increasing pressure from housing campaigners and organisations across the country, including Awaab’s parents, ‘Awaab’s law’ was passed as part of the Social Housing Regulation Act 2023. Awaab’s law requires landlords to investigate and fix reported health hazards within specific timeframes. It is now the landlord’s responsibility to identify and address the underlying causes of damp and mould.</p>

<p>However, Awaab’s law does not apply to all landlords. Asylum seekers, private renters and families being temporarily housed will not benefit from this, and we know that some of the worst conditions are in these types of accommodation. These small step changes to legislation should be rolled out to all providers of housing, not just social housing. Furthermore, without enforcement, such laws are not worth the paper they’re written on. Awaab’s Law is due to come into effect in 2024 - if you or someone you know is experiencing issues in their property and would like support to force your housing provider to address them, please come down and see us at SNCK and we will do what we can do help!</p>



<h2 class="caps">Racism, Islamaphobia and Fascism Off Our Streets</h2>
<label>August 6, 2024</label>

<p>The events of the last week are the result of successive governments and those with power, wealth and vested interests pushing division and hate through propaganda, misinformation, toxic narratives and racist policies for many years.</p>

<p>We know who to blame for the social issues tearing our country apart, however the violence of the past week has not been directed towards those in power who are responsible for our broken housing, healthcare and education systems, but towards Migrants, Muslims and Global Majority people who are the backbone of our communities, and with whom we stand shoulder to shoulder. It is these people who, yet again, are bearing the brunt of the failed politics of this country, and it is everyone’s responsibility to change this.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">We will continue unwaveringly in our efforts to bring about working class unity across races, religions and ethnicities. This is our strongest weapon in building a better world and pushing back against the fascists and white supremacists that are organising right now across the country.</span> SNCK is more than a kitchen. We are a community that uses food and people power to build strength, resilience and solidarity. Resistance against hatred and division is built into our very existence, and in every hour and in every act we prove the far right wrong.</p>

<p>If you need a supportive place of sanctuary in Croydon this week then our doors are open from 10am-3pm Tues-Fri and 9am-2pm on Saturday as usual. You are all welcome. Please reach out to us if you or a local organising group need support, whether that be a meeting space, hot food, flyers, or callouts to actions. Our DMs and doors are open.</p>

<p>Resistance in defence of our communities is being organised over the coming weeks, as has been seen in multiple cities over the weekend. Keep an eye on our socials for information.</p>


<h2 class="caps">Turning Food Waste into Hope and Sustainability</h2>
<label>July 4, 2024</label>

<p>We had the privilege of welcoming Santana and Abraham and other year 10s from Oasis Shirley Park to the Community Kitchen for their work experience. They wrote us an article about food waste while they were here</p>
<hr/>
<em>
<p>Food waste is a significant global issue, with profound social, economic and environmental impacts. Each year, an estimated 1.3 billion tonnes of food is wasted, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, squandering resources and exacerbating food insecurity. Community led initiatives like the South Norwood Community Kitchen are making a substantial difference in reducing food waste and fostering food justice.</p>

<p>SNCK operates to alleviate hunger and minimize food waste. SNCK began as a grassroots initiative to address food insecurity within the local community. Its core activities revolve around rescuing food from supermarkets, restaurants, and other businesses that would otherwise be discarded and creating nutritious meals, saving 33 tonnes (or 33,000 kilos) of food producing 15,000 meals per year. In addition to community meals, SNCK runs a food pantry, distributing surplus food directly to individuals and families. This initiative allows community members to take home groceries that might otherwise go to waste, providing them with a dignified way to access the food they need. The pantry operates for free, ensuring that financial constraints do not prevent anyone from accessing food.</p>

<p>Educational programmes are another vital component of SNCK’s strategy to reduce food waste.</p>
<p>SNCK hosts workshops and cooking classes aimed at teaching community members how to make the most of the food they have, reduce waste in their homes, and adopt sustainable eating practices. These programmes empower individuals with the knowledge and skills to make a positive impact on food waste reduction at a personal level.</p>

<p>The impact of SNCK extends beyond just food waste reduction. By bringing people together around food, SNCK builds a stronger and more resilient community. It offers a space for social interaction, support and fostering a sense of belonging. The Kitchen also engages with local schools and organizations, raising awareness about food waste and sustainability among younger generations. The Kitchen is a haven for a diverse group of compassionate and dedicated individuals who come together to make a meaningful difference, from volunteers who give up their time and energy, to neighbours who bring surplus foods from their own cupboards, the community’s spirit of generosity shines brightly. These loving and caring people help create an atmosphere of warmth and acceptance, ensuring that everyone who walks through the doors feels valued and supported. Their collective efforts not only reduce food waste but also foster a sense of unity and resilience.</p>

<p>In conclusion, SNCK exemplifies how community-led initiatives can play a crucial role in addressing the issue of food waste. By rescuing surplus food and transforming it into nutritious meals and groceries for those in need, SNCK not only reduces waste but also promotes food security and community cohesion. Their efforts highlight the importance of local action in tackling global problems, demonstrating that with creativity, dedication, and collaboration, significant change is possible.</p>

<h2 class="caps">The Right to Food</h2>
<label>July 4, 2024</label>


<p>At SNCK we believe that everyone has a right to access food regardless of who they are and regardless of their circumstance. Whilst we work to get nutritious food to everyone who needs it in Croydon, our hearts are with Muslims around the world for whom food and water likely did not feature at all in their Eid celebrations this year. This includes Palestinians suffering mass indiscriminate loss of life in Gaza under Israel’s relentless genocidal destruction and manufactured famine, designed to undermine Palestinian people’s right to exist. This also includes citizens of Sudan who are facing the world’s largest hunger emergency due to ongoing conflict, and the people of Yemen who suffer under the long drawn out Yemeni Civil War</p>

<p>Please support all calls for #ceasefirenow and to end U.K. complicity in arms supplies to perpetrators of genocide and war. There are many ways to help:</p>

<ol>
   <li>Joining your local Palestine solidarity demonstration</li>
   <li>Writing to your MP calling on them to support ceasefire and ending arms supply motions and signing petitions like this one https://shorturl.at/pMPS0</li>
   <li>Donating money directly to organisations like the World Food Programme and UNICEF which have emergency appeals for all these countries. Gaza: https://shorturl.at/prsDQ Sudan: https://shorturl.at/wyFIT Yemen: https://shorturl.at/xBE69</li>
   <li>Amplify the voices of Palestinians whenever and wherever you can</li>

<h2 class="caps">It's Time to Reclaim English Football</h2>

<label>July 26, 2021</label>

<p>The Euros this summer haven’t just been interesting to watch. They’ve raised some interesting and important conversations around English football, racism and whether we can genuinely oppose racism whilst still supporting the England football team due to the infamous reputation of England fans as far right bigots.</p>

<p>The decision by our players to take the knee in a stance against racism has been met with opposition by some England fans, who shamed themselves by booing our players for doing so (whilst still cheering every time Sterling put the ball in the back of the net). If this wasn’t bad enough, the vile racist abuse that Rashford, Sancho & Saka were subject to after the final makes clear that racism is still rife in English football.</p>

<p>The question of whether English football goes hand in hand with racism is one that I’ve discussed with different people in pubs and workplaces since the Euros began, and each person seems to have a different perspective based on their own experiences. Whilst for lots of people, expressions of pride in England cannot be detached from racism; many others have asked <em>“what on earth does football have to do with racism?”</em></p>

<p>As someone who grew up following Chelsea, I am under no illusion that unfortunately the answer to that question is – a lot. Both overt and subtle racism are commonplace in football grounds across the country, and the booing of the knee, as well as the racist abuse following the final, are further examples of this. It is worth pointing out that sadly this is a reflection of England as a whole, and isn’t exclusive to football.</p>

<p>The hijacking of the St. George’s cross by far right groups such as the National Front & EDL also goes a long way to explaining why many minority communities cannot bring themselves to get behind a country that has shown hatred & intolerance to them, their parents & their grandparents since they arrived here as a consequence of Britain’s brutal imperialism.</p>

<p>However, if we concede both our national flag and support of our national football team to the far right, where do we go from there? Racists & fascists have always tried to hijack & permeate any part of working class culture they can get their hands on; from different music genres and football to the skinhead scene in the 60s and 70s. We cannot let them do this, because if supporting England becomes synonymous with racism, people who grow up loving football and naturally supporting our nation’s football team will feel as though they have a lot more in common with racists than they actually do. Without opposition, their ideas & confidence will grow.</p>

<blockquote>Let the racists know their time is up-they are not welcome in our pubs and stadiums.</blockquote>

<p>Instead, we need to reclaim football and Englishness from the far right, and make it clear that we can be completely opposed to racism at the same time as loving football and the England football team. Now that our team is made up almost completely of lads from working class backgrounds with heritage all over the world, there is no better time to let racists know that their time is up – they are not welcome in our pubs and stadiums, and their hateful, divisive ideas will not be tolerated. Racism needs to be opposed wherever it rears its head, and football is no different.</p>

<p>This won’t be easy, because we’re countering the division & lies pushed by all the institutions of the system every day, as well as catching up on 40 years of anti-racist organising in football that didn’t happen when it should have. However, if we’re serious about building anti-racism in this country, it has to be done. We cannot just concede football and pretend it was always a lost cause.</p>
<blockquote>We need to cultivate and build our anti-racist response.
</blockquote>

<p>As working class people living in England, obviously our identities are diverse and based on our very different experiences in this country. Some of us are English going back several generations, whereas many others have heritage all over the world and have more personal experiences with this country’s wicked colonial past (and present). This diversity is made clear by the different responses to the question of whether we can get behind our national football team whilst opposing racism. For me, supporting a team of players who have consistently stood up to, been victims of and spoken out against racism in the face of condemnation from their own ‘fans’ is in itself an anti-racist act. The support and solidarity shown for Saka, Sancho and Rashford showed us that supporting the national football team in an actively anti-racist way is possible.In fact,instead of it being impossible to be anti-racist and support England, the opposite is now the case – it is impossible to be racist and support England. However, I certainly won’t be judging or condemning anyone who feels uncomfortable with the England flags being flown everywhere and who can’t bring themselves to support England.</p>

<p>For every racist message sent to our players, there were 10 acts of solidarity and love sent in response. Rather than write off English football as a sport for racists and bigots, we need to cultivate and build the anti-racist response that has been seen across the country. Believe it or not, working class anti-racist football fans exist. We’re here to stay, to fight racism and to build in our communities.</p>




<h2 class="caps">An end to the verification of street homeless people</h2>
<label>November 6, 2023</label>


<p>We are writing this letter to highlight the potentially deadly experience of street homeless people who are waiting for verification, particularly during times of extreme weather, and provide alternatives.</p>

<p>As I’m sure you’re aware, no homeless person can be given a safe and warm place to sleep unless they have been ‘verified’. This involves a homeless outreach worker physically seeing you ‘bedded down’ (ie in some kind of makeshift bed on the street) and therefore proving that you are sleeping rough as you say you are. No one except a member of the homelessness outreach team can verify you as being street homeless. At best it cantake days for outreach workers to go and ‘verify’ someone sleeping rough, and at worst it never happens.</p>

<p>The Severe Weather Emergency Protocol (SWEP) is an ‘emergency response to prevent the deaths of people sleeping rough during winter’. It is designed to get people off the streets while the weather is cold enough to be a threat to life. If you’re new to the streets though, what’s stopping you from freezing to death is luck, not SWEP. That’s because even though it’s cold enough for you to die if you sleep outside all night, you still have to be proved to be homeless, by someone seeing you sleeping outside.</p>

<p>Telling someone who sleeps on the streets that they have to keep sleeping on the streets until some random person with a name badge turns up in the middle of the night to ‘verify you’ is bad enough. Telling that to someone when it is minus temperatures, or snowing, is inhumane. The sickest thing is, as a concerned community member, you can’t even let them sleep on your sofa, have a shower, pay for them to stay in a hotel for a night, because they will miss the mysterious and elusive visit from an outreach worker that could literally happen at any moment over multiple days, to a specific spot you’ve said you are sleeping at. Draconian is an understatement.</p>

<p>SWEP being activated itself is an acknowledgement that conditions are cold enough to be a threat to life, and yet the requirement for verification even in these conditions still exists.</p>

<p>Many people in our community are street homeless, or have experienced street homelessness. At South Norwood Community Kitchen we support people who come to us wanting to get off the streets by meeting their basic needs (food, clothes, sleeping bag, etc) and doing our best to get them linked in with homelessness services that can provide them with accommodation. This is never, ever an easy task. This winter, time and time again we have struggled to navigate both Street Link and SWEP in order to ‘prevent the deaths of people sleeping rough’. This winter, a 70 year old vulnerable man was left to sleep outside for 6 nights and a couple new to the streets forced to squat a garage for 3 nights in the snow. We did everything we could to get them inside during that time, to no avail.</p>

<p>We are calling for an end to the pointless verification process, particularly when SWEP is activated. Going into Spring does not mean this problem gets left till next winter. It’s a chance to work with the community to improve the system and stop people freezing to death on the streets of Croydon. Social workers, charities, faith organisations and community projects who all work directly with people sleeping on the streets should be able to verify someone as rough sleeping, without the need for an outreach worker to do so via the convoluted verification process.</p>

<p>The current system is costing lives, unnecessary suffering and leaving support agencies frustrated and powerless in being able to save our vulnerable rough sleepers from freezing to death. A drastic change in how rough sleeping referrals are made and handled needs to be put in place before any more of our community suffer.</p>


<h2 class="caps">'Is everyone allowed the free food?'</h2>

</em></p>

<p>(A sample of conversations at the South Norwood Community Kitchen)</p>

<p>Conversations are beautiful things. They are even more beautiful when they are between people who have never met before or come from different walks of life. The conflicts and the negotiations that take place but often the realisation of shared experiences, and the vitality that they take away in meeting someone new and learning that they didn’t fit the stereotype that they originally presumed.</p>

<p>Through our community project, The South Norwood Community kitchen, the purpose was not just to enable people to have a good feed but also to create a truly inclusive, free space for people from all over the community to meet and to have this kind of conversations. To break down walls and barriers.</p>

<p>We believe that we are in desperate need of spaces like this in a society that has become increasingly fearful of others and public space. The pervasiveness of individualism and competitiveness in our culture has bred an anxiety towards community where difference is not positive but something to be actively suppressed and avoided. Public spaces where our differences are played out and materially experienced have lost value and hence we see the closure of our community centres, the selling off of our public land and collectivity spatially dismantled.</p>

<p>Public space has become shaped through a highly controlled architecture of purpose, functionality, and abjection. The presence of security, time restrictions, a lack of comfortable places to sit has engineered spaces that are just made for ‘passing through’ not as rich, vibrant, diverse civic spaces that enable active participation for everyone in society.</p>

<p>Increasing privatisation of public space has rendered unpredictability, chance encounters, fluidity in our communal spaces as suspicious, unnecessary and something to be controlled. What we are left with are sterile, exclusive commercially driven ecologies where social relations are transactional and placed under temporal prohibitions – even our parks have opening and closing times.</p>

<p>They are spaces of abjection where only certain kinds of people and certain kinds of behaviours are allowed to interact, in the pubs, the cafes, the restaurants, the shopping centres – those who have money and the appropriate ‘consumer’ capital in terms of lifestyle and affluent aspirations can take part.</p>

<p>Those that do not fit the normative body such as the marginal, the poor, the disabled are moved to the fringes which creates highly polarised spatial experiences that map out their everyday lives. This means that those who materially ‘fit’ and those that don’t fit will often not cross paths and this lack of contact only helps to exacerbate the sense of arbitrary ‘difference’ between social groups. This gap of ‘difference’ harbours fear and ultimately prejudice. Think of those communities in the UK who have reported high levels of negativity towards ethnic minorities but very rarely interact with different ethnic groups on a daily basis.</p>

<p>We are all familiar with signs that tell us ‘no loitering’ or ‘no ball games’ which often punctuate the landscape of social housing. But these signs are built into our general spatial psyche, we are suspicious of strangers, of staying too long in one place. As Anna Minton describes, there is an architecture of fear that pervades our public worlds. ‘Other’ people, unless they look like us and act like us are rejected so that we can protect the borders of our ‘knowable’ worlds, – what we end up with is a deeply segregated society with fragmented communities that interact in siloes rather than as a cohesive, dynamic whole.</p>

<p>Diversity breeds creativity and without it we are reduced to anodyne, beige worlds. What do you get when you put two heads together with the same life experiences? What do you get when you put two heads together with different life experiences? Something new.</p>

<p>Community = Space. Without spaces, community cannot exist. Without truly democratic, engaged spaces then communities cannot flourish and enable people of all walks of life to participate and create together inclusive, playful public spaces. Through the community kitchen, we want people to loiter, to linger, collide with other people and build the connections to develop an integrated and shared community. So we are no longer passive and told what to do but can have an empowered say and interaction with how our worlds work. But also to learn something new about themselves and break down personal borders that inhibit certain types of personal expression so that identities become more fluid and less rigid.</p>

<p>One thing that we have also found is that people are often suspicious of something being ‘free’ and how ‘freeness’ is only seen as being available to those who are less well off, as if those that are comfortable financially disregard something that does not involve a financial transaction – to get something for nothing makes it meaningless. In our capitalist world, valuable exchange is defined through financial means, whereas exchange should be regarded through social resources – life experiences, other skills and attributes that can be brought to social relationships. We need to redefine the terms of what we mean by exchange in our society based on communality and not individualism, greed and exclusivity.</p>

<p>These are big things, and requires a complete transformation of the way we regard others and our participation in pubic life. Our community kitchen like many other local projects going on around us are just small pieces that fit into a very large puzzle. There is no top-down panacea that can come in and change everything all at once. It will take piecemeal, small local spaces and initiatives that work on an everyday and grassroots level to bring communities together and bring all of our wonderful, messy, unpredictable lives into one space.</p>
